  What is it for:

    The major problem of template code is the potentialy huge binary
  size that can result from the compilation. Each template type 
  instanciation is a new type from the compiler point of view even if
  the generated binaries are identicals. To avoid this binary duplication
  STLport grant the partial pointer specialization for 4 containers:
    - vector
    - deque
    - list
    - slist

  How does it work:

    The partial pointer specialization consists in using a void* 
  container instanciation for any container of pointers, including 
  pointer to cv qualified types. So the container partial pointer 
  specializations are only bridges that forward all the method calls 
  to the underlying void* container instanciation. The bridge job 
  is to cast the pointer type to and from the void* type. This only
  work for compiler supporting the partial template specialization.
  
  Why only those 4 containers:

    Some of your might wonder why none of the associative containers
  or hash containers has been specialized. Lets take the set container
  as an example. Its declaration is

    template <class _Tp, 
              class _Compare = less<_Tp>,
              class _Alloc = allocator<_Tp> >
    class set;

    In a first thought you can imagine a partial specialization like
  the following:

    template <class _Tp, class _Compare, class _Alloc>
    class set<_Tp*, _Compare, _Alloc>

    What would be the underlying container for such a partial 
  specialization? The _Alloc type is supposed to have a rebind member
  method so you can easily find the _VoidAlloc type. The _Compare type,
  on the other hand, do not have this kind of requirements from the 
  Standard. So you need to wrap the _Compare type within a _WrapCompare
  type that will take care of all the cast work. The underlying 
  container type will be:
  
    set<void*, _WrapCompare, _VoidAlloc>

    The problem of such a type is that it is still dependent on the 
  original _Tp type for the _WrapCompare instanciation. So each set
  instanciation will have a distinct underlying void* container and
  we fall back on a binary duplication trouble.

    On a second thought a possible solution is to limit the partial
  specialization like that:

    template <class _Tp, class _Alloc>
    class set<_Tp*, less<_Tp*>, _Alloc>

    We only specialized the set container if the comparison functor
  is the Standard less struct. The underlying container would be:

    set<void*, less<void*>, _VoidAlloc>

    It looks fine but it is wrong. Actually a STL client is free to
  specialized the less struct for any pointer type even the basic one.
  In such a situation the client would think that the set is ordered
  according its own functor but will finally have a set ordered according
  the less<void*> functor. The less specialization issue also show that
  the underlying cannot be a

    set<void*, less<void*>, _VoidAlloc>

  but will have to be a

    set<void*, __less<void*>, _VoidAlloc>

  where __less would be equivalent to the standard less functor but 
  would not be specializable because unreachable from the client code.

    There is of course a solution for this specialization issue. We 
  need to be able to detect the less specialization. The partial set
  specialization would have to be used only if the less functor is 
  the real default implementation based on the strict ordering operator.
  This can only be achieve by adding a fourth template parameter to 
  the set declaration. But now we enter the Standard conformance area
  which hasn't been discuss yet so wait and see...
