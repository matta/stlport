The following changes were made in 4.1 beta 4 since 4.1 beta 3 :
	
	* Simulation of class partial specialization (thanks to  Mat Marcus and Jesse Jones of Adobe)
	  used to provide following enhancements :
	
	 - type_traits are automatically specialized for all pointer types for all compilers, 
	   which makes them able to utilize type_traits-based optimizations when dealing with pointer types, 
	   automatically.
	
	 - all functions specialized for pointers and optimized via __type_traits
	   ( like copy()/copy_backward(), _uninitialized_xx) now enjoy this optimization for all compilers!
        
	- generic __value_type()/__difference_type()/__iterator_category() are written so user does not have
	   to supply any of its own even when partial specialization is not available.
	   (Note : gcc-2.7 and VC++ 5.x, 6.x have bugs which prevents them from using this enhancement, still)
	
	* <iterator> : by default, non-standard iterator query names like 
	  value_type()/difference_type()/iterator_category() are not used
	
	* <algo> : major revision:
	   - algorithms without explicit Compare() function expressed via the one that has it where possible.
	     This considerably reduces header size and reduces code bloat for programs which use both flavours of
	     those algorithms.
	   - some function bodies moved between  .c and .h 
	   - all functions used internally moved out to _algobase.h, so no other header includes <_algo.h> anymore
	   - find() specialized for random access iterators regardless of partial spec.

	* Dynamic libraries (.DLL and .so) : name versioning used to prevent clashes between STLport versions

	* src/ : code regrouped between .cpp files to provide for less executable size with dumb linkers;

	* locale subsystem initialization : startup changed to use statically allocated structures as much as possible;
	
	* <stl/_function.h> : basic stuff moved to _function_base.h ; 
	  other STL headers now include _function_base.h instead

	* _threads.h : MT support for OS/2 added (only tested with VAC++)

	* _stdio_file.h : added support for Solaris in ELF64 mode (thanks to Holger Stasch)
	
	* stl/_hashtable.h : [] operator for hash_map optimized to take no more than find() when element is present
	  (Thanks to Thomas Witt et al.)

	* all __STL_ABBREVS abbreviations moved aside in _abbrevs.h header.

	* fstream.cpp : __pioinfo used for MinGW32 (thanks to Danny Smith)

	* list<>::clear() : protected access bug fixed

	* __STL_MUTEX_INITIALIZER set back to PTHREAD_MUTEX_INITIALIZER for pthreads case, 
	  as some platforms (eg AIX) do not treat zero-initialized mutex as valid one (thanks to Alex Vanic, Jack Andrews for help)
	
	* stl/_limits.c : fixed typo preventing numeric limits constants to be defined for __STL_LITTLE_ENDIAN,
	  constants initialization fixed (thanks to Ingo Donasch)  

	* real implementation of locales for Win32 contributed by Anton Lapach (thanks !) merged in.
	
	* stl_user_config.h, _config.h : changed default to not define relops:: operators
	  in __STL_NO_NAMESPACES mode.

	* _numeric_facets.c/num_put.cpp : printing of integer do not use sprintf() anymore

	* "install" target implemented for UNIX & VC++ Makefiles. It now installs headers and libraries.

	* "src" : files merged to get less compilation time and less space overhead for imperfect compilers

	  please use __STL_USE_DEBUG_LIB and build debug STLport lib explicitly with "make debug_dynamic" 
	  if you really need it). "all" now builds 2 kinds : "release" and "STLdebug", for static and dynamic builds.  

	* stlport_prefix.h : WIN32_LEAN_AND_MEAN set for Win32 build of STLport library, for speed.

	* FreeBSD compile fixed; makefiles added.

	* Regression test suite changed to new-style headers - thanks to
	  Dima Pasechnik for the initial port.
	
	* <rope> fixes for Watcom

	* many miscellanous fixes.
	
The following changes were made in 3.2.2 beta 3 since 3.2.2 Beta 2:

	* Merged changes made to SGI standard library snapshot in December.
	
	* std:: is not used for STLport namespace even with SGI iostreams,
	  to avoid possible clashes and facilitate 3rd-party library use.
          Same macro redefinition technique for stlport:: used to keep clients
	  code with literal std:: happy as in native iostreams mode.
	
	* C library headers wrapping changed to allow multiple inclusion tricks
	  (needed by gcc-2.95 mostly)
	
	* gcc-2.95 and CodeWarrior configurations updated.

	* HP aCC fixes applied.

	* Visual C++ - added static library targets, build refined.
	  Fixed memory-mapping bugs.
	
	* auto_ptr updated, now it passes polymorphic tests with VC++.

	* Many small bugfixes.
	
The following changes were made in 3.2.2 beta 2 since 3.2.2 Beta 1:

	* Fixed SUN CC deque<> problem with -g
	
	* Added configuration and makefiles for DEC VMS, Borland and Win32 gcc.

	* Merged changes made to November SGI standard library snapshot.

	* config changes - "configure" made obsolete and moved into "stlport/config/new_compiler".

	* __STL_TYPENAME_ON_RETURN_TYPE handling changed.
	
	* Miscellanous fixes.

The following changes were made in 3.2.2 Beta 1 since 3.2.1 release:

	* SGI iostreams adopted. To use SGI iostreams, user have to set
	  __SGI_STL_OWN_IOSTREAMS flag and to build the library in "src"
	  directory to link with. Please read INSTALL file for detailed
	  instructions.
	  Default setting is NOT to use SGI iostreams (wrappers used as before).

	* Debug mode completely redesigned - debug mode containers are 
	  implemented in terms of wrappers around non-debug ones.
	  That provides for more clean and efficient implementation and
	  binary compatibility between debug and non-debug versions.

	* Additional configurations added for platforms :
	     - gcc-2.95
	     - SUNpro CC 5.0 in "compatibility" mode
	  "configure" made obsolete.
	
	* Bugfixes reported by users since 3.2.1 release merged 

The following changes were made in 3.2.1 since 3.2 release:

	* Now, by default, STLPort renames std:: namespace for user
	  if __STL_USE_OWN_NAMESPACE is used. To make it possible, many new
	  wrapper headers introduced. Internally, STLport uses stlport:: namespace,
	  so no link- or run- time clashes are possible, and you don't have to rebuild
	  the runtime lib (which you don't want to).
	  This feature makes STLport usable out-of-the box, without any modifications
	  for client code, with any compiler.

	* Code bloat reduction : hashtable<T> uses vector<void*> internally.

	* Vector : efficiency/code bloat reduction fixes.

	* Visual C++ : DLL export is supported for allocators and strings. To use it, 
	  please define __STL_USE_DECLSPEC in all modules and __STL_DESIGNATED_DLL
	  for the DLL which is supposed to instantiate STLport exports (at least one
	  source of this DLL must include <string>.

        * Visual C++ : for MT synchronization, <windows.h> is not included anymore.
	
	* For Sunpro C++ 5.0 : all headers are linked into stlport/SC5, so only
	  one include path is needed. Note that SC5.0 has problems with relative 
	  search path. It is easy to work around : in your makefiles, instead of
	  "STL_INCL=../.." , write "STL_INCL=${PWD}/../..".

	* Configuration files provided for compilers : 
	   KAI C++
	   DEC C++ (6.x, 5.x)
	   Borland 5.02 is back on the road (finally !)
	  
	* Windows CE config provided for Visual C++.

	* __STL_NO_IOSTREAMS switch introduced for embedded platforms.
	
	* Lots of minor config fixes and improvements for various platforms.
