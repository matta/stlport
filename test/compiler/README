This is tests to check wether compiler understand or not some language construction.
It is NOT tests for language support libraries!

The main purposes of this tests is help for developers to find correct workarounds,
if compiler don't understand some (correct) language constructions.

Notes about tests.

ttei1.cpp, ttei2.cpp, ttei3.cpp, ttei4.cpp, ttei5.cpp:
tests for template-in-the-template explicit specialization. ttei1.cpp, ttei2.cpp
may be used as workaround for ttei3.cpp, ttei4.cpp (I am expect that last are
compiled correctly by VC6).
